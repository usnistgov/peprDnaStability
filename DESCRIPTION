Description: The peprDnaStability package was developed to facilitate analysis
    of pulse field gel electrophoresis results of the NIST genomic DNA reference
    material.  The package includes a shiny app (FindMarkers) that is used to
    identify the positions and size of the gel ladder bands.  The parameters for
    identifying the marker position are exported from the app and used as input
    for batch image processing and statistical analysis.
Depends: R (>= 3.1.2)
